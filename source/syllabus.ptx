    <title>Course Description</title>
    <p>
      This course covers the topics in algebra and trigonometry necessary for students who plan to enroll in MATH 221. Topics include functions, compositions and inverses, and domain and range. Polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions are examined in depth, with an emphasis on symbolic methods, parameters that describe each family of functions, and multiple representations of functions (algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal representations).

      If you need to miss class, that is ok. If you miss class, be sure to check Canvas and Webwork for assignments, and try to get notes from a classmate. If you're still having difficulty with the material, use office hours or the Peer Education Center to get caught up. If you need an extension on an assignment, just ask your professor and it will likely be granted.

    <p>
      If you need to miss class for an extended period of time, let your professor know so that we may work out a remote accommodation.

    Competency in quantitative literacy represents a student’s ability to use quantifiable information and mathematical analysis to make connections and draw conclusions. Students with strong quantitative literacy skills understand and can create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc.).

      Webwork is our online homework system. An account has been created for you and a link posted on Canvas. You should check Webwork every class day for new assignments. Their due dates are posted with the assignment. Typically, Webwork assignments will be due at 11:59pm two business days after that section's material has been completed in class. Thus, we have the following:

    </p>
    <p>
      Because online homework tells you if your answer is right or wrong as soon as you submit it, and for most questions you will be allowed multiple submissions, doing online homework may take you longer than doing written homework. So, give yourself plenty of time by starting your homework ASAP after it is assigned. This will give you time to do the assignment and get help if you need it.

    <p>
      Stay enrolled in this and your other courses this term by attending class and participating in required course activities during the first week of the term. Instructors have the option to disenroll a student from a class if the student has missed at least one scheduled class in person or via Zoom or required online course activity for online courses (check your syllabus for information) during the first 4 days of the week in which the course is scheduled to meet for the first time. This allows students who are on the course waitlist to be added to the course.

    <title>Course Workload and Time Management</title>
    <p>
      How can you create a weekly schedule based on your courses and study time needed for success? As long as you know the number of credit hours you are taking, it’s easy!  In a face-to-face class, one course credit is the same as one hour of lecture per week for a 15-week term. Additionally, you need to plan for a minimum of two more hours of preparation for each credit hour (and that's according to the federal definition of a credit hour). Thus, in this face-to-face 4-credit course we will meet in person for 4 hours per week, and you should plan on a minimum average of 8 hours per week of homework, reading, and preparation outside of class. Some weeks it may be less; some weeks it may be more. This weekly amount of homework and preparation time will typically vary based on a number of factors about you as a learner and student. Please let me know if you fall behind or need any help figuring out your weekly schedule and meeting these course workload expectations.

      Each member of this class is responsible for contributing to and maintaining an atmosphere of respect for all other members. This means each of us is responsible for ensuring that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          All perspectives and experiences are respected.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Class discussions and individual comments are respectful and do not degrade, stereotype, or promote deficit thinking about any group or individual.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Each person in the class has an opportunity to articulate their perspective and ideas without being demeaned.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Students who demonstrate a disregard for this responsibility will be alerted that their attitudes and/or actions inhibit a respectful and safe learning environment. The instructor reserves the right to take appropriate disciplinary action.

    <title>Email and Netiquitte</title>
    <p>
       “Netiquette” is a protocol for interacting and behaving online.  Although digital interactions are not face-to-face, they affect real people; thus, we must be sensitive to the fact that our words impact others.  The following are an outline of ways that you can communicate professionally and sensitively online:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>
          Be sensitive to others' cultural, social, political and linguistic backgrounds.  Everyone is different and unique.  Remember to show respect for our differences.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Incorporate professionalism and good taste when composing responses in discussion forums, online collaboration and feedback tools, and other interactive spaces.  Avoid profanity and other harsh comments.  Minimize your use of slang, as it can be misinterpreted.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Avoid using all capital letters as it can be construed as “shouting” online, which can be perceived as aggressive behavior.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          When using acronyms, make sure to clarify its meaning when you first use in your message.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>
          Proofread your responses for accuracy and tone.

    <title>Academic Integrity</title>
    <p>
      <term>What is Academic Integrity?</term> Integrity is the College-wide expectation that students follow established guidelines and common knowledge to maintain ethical standards in their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Why does it matter?</term> Integrity in academic matters is vital to all members of the College community. An academic integrity violation by a student devalues the accomplishments of other students, threatens the integrity of the College, and undermines the College’s educational mission. During their time at FLC, students are expected to know, understand, and comply with the ethical standards of the College.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>What is Academic Dishonesty?</term> Academic dishonesty is defined as any form of unethical or illegal behavior regarding any academic work--with or without intent. These standards apply to all courses taken on or off campus, and all modes of course delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, the following:
    </p>
      <ul>
  <li>
    <p>
      plagiarism,
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>
      cheating,

  </li>
  <li>
