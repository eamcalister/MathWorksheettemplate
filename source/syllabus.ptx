    <title>Course Description</title>
    <p>
      This course covers the topics in algebra and trigonometry necessary for students who plan to enroll in MATH 221. Topics include functions, compositions and inverses, and domain and range. Polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions are examined in depth, with an emphasis on symbolic methods, parameters that describe each family of functions, and multiple representations of functions (algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal representations).

    <p>
      If you need to miss class, that is ok. If you miss class, be sure to check Canvas and Webwork for assignments, and try to get notes from a classmate. If you're still having difficulty with the material, use office hours or the Peer Education Center to get caught up. If you need an extension on an assignment, just ask your professor and it will likely be granted.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you need to miss class for an extended period of time, let your professor know so that we may work out a remote accommodation.

      You will need to be able to access Canvas and Webwork (online homework system) as submit assignments online. Internet access and a scanning device are required. Calculators will not be used on exams, but will frequently be useful for homework and in class.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            Students demonstrate an understanding of functions in multiple ways including graphical representations, algebraic representations, and verbal descriptions.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Students will demonstrate understanding of abstract function notation, proficiency working with abstract functions, and understanding functions that are not defined algebraically. This shall include working with affine transformations of functions, definitions of inverses and compositions of functions, and working with functions that are defined geometrically.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Students will demonstrate proficiency working with parametrized families of functions. These families shall include linear functions, polynomials, rational functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and trigonometric functions. Transformations, inverses, and compositions of such functions will also be addressed. Skills shall include finding parameter values from data, evaluating functions, solving equations, and selecting which family would best represent a given data set/real world application.

    <p>This course meets the following gtPathway Student Learning Outcomes: Quantitative Literacy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Competency in quantitative literacy represents a studentâ€™s ability to use quantifiable information and mathematical analysis to make connections and draw conclusions. Students with strong quantitative literacy skills understand and can create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc.).
