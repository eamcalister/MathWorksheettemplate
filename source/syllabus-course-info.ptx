    <title>Course Description</title>
    <p>
      This course covers the topics in algebra and trigonometry necessary for students who plan to enroll in MATH 221. Topics include functions, compositions and inverses, and domain and range. Polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions are examined in depth, with an emphasis on symbolic methods, parameters that describe each family of functions, and multiple representations of functions (algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal representations).

      If you need to miss class, that is ok. If you miss class, be sure to check Canvas and Webwork for assignments, and try to get notes from a classmate. If you're still having difficulty with the material, use office hours or the Peer Education Center to get caught up. If you need an extension on an assignment, just ask your professor and it will likely be granted.

    <p>
      If you need to miss class for an extended period of time, let your professor know so that we may work out a remote accommodation.
