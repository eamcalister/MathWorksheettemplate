            <introduction><title>Linear and Quadratic Functions as Shifts and Stretches</title>
                <p>
                    The families of all linear and quadratic functions can each be built using simpler functions: <m>l(x) = mx</m> (for positive values of <m>m</m>) and <m>q(x) = ax^2</m> (for positive values of <m>a</m>), for linear and quadratic functions, respectively. What does this mean exactly? It means every linear function is a shift and/or reflection of <m>l(x)</m> and every quadratic function is a shift and/or reflection of <m>q(x)</m>. In this worksheet we'll explore this idea.

    Now suppose that instead of having a <m>y</m>-intercept at <m>y=7</m>, we want a function that passes through the point <m>(3,7)</m>. What additional transformation needs to be applied to your basic function from part (b)? Find the formula for this transformation and graph it.

    Suppose you take <m>g(x)</m> and reflect its graph across the <m>y</m>-axis, then reflect it across the <m>x</m>-axis resulting in a new function <m>h(x)</m>.

    Another way to find the vertex of a quadratic using simpler functions and shifts. Consider the function
    <me>
    g(x) = 2x^2-6x+20.
    </me>
    </p>
    <p>
    We can write this as a vertical shift of the function <m>f(x) = 2x^2-6x</m> upward by <m>20</m> units. Notice that
    <md>
    <mrow>f(x) \amp = 2x^2 - 6x</mrow>
    <mrow> \ \amp = 2x(x-3) </mrow>
    </md>
    </p>
    <p>
    Notice that <m>f(x)</m> (from which <m>g(x)</m> came) has easily identified zeros at <m>x=0</m> and <m>x=3</m>. It's vertex lies halfway between them at <m>x=1.5</m>. Then we can compute the <m>y</m>-value of this vertex to be
    <me>
    f(1.5) = 2\cdot 1.5 \cdot (-1.5) = -4.5.
    </me>
    Thus, the vertex of <m>g(x)</m> is <m>20</m> units higher at <m>y = 15.5</m>. So the vertex form of <m>g(x)</m> is
    <me>
    g(x) = 2x^2-6x+20 = 2(x-1.5)^2 + 15.5
    </me>
    <em>Your task:</em> Use the idea from the example to put the function
    <me>
    h(x) = -3x^2+5x - 7 = -3x\left(x-\frac{5}{3}\right) -7
    </me>
    into vertex form.
