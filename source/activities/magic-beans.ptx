            <title>Magic Beans</title>
            <introduction>
                <p>
                    You have traded your cow for 5 magic chocolate covered espresso beans.
                    Each night at midnight, each bean splits into three beans.
                    To take advantage of this, you eat 8 beans each morning for breakfast.
                    You wonder how many beans you will have <em>after</em> breakfast 30 days after you traded your cow.
                </p>
        
                <p>
                    Let <m>(b_n)_{n\ge 0}</m> be the sequence of number of beans you have <m>n</m> days after trading your cow, (after breakfast, before midnight; take <m>b_0 = 5</m>).
                </p>

                            Then give a recursive definition for the sequence and explain how you know it is correct.

                        Another way to find the vertex of a quadratic using simpler functions and shifts. Consider the function
                        <m>
                        g(x) = 2x^2-6x+20.
                        </m>
                    </p>
                    <!--p>
                        We can write this as a vertical shift of the function $f(x) = 2x^2-6x$ upward by $20$ units. Notice that
                        <me>
                        <mrow>f(x) \amp = \amp 2x^2 - 6x</mrow>
                        <mrow> \ \amp = \amp 2x(x-3) </mrow>
                        </me>
