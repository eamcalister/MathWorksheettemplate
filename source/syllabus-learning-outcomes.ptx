        <li>
          <p>
            Students demonstrate an understanding of functions in multiple ways including graphical representations, algebraic representations, and verbal descriptions.

        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Students will demonstrate understanding of abstract function notation, proficiency working with abstract functions, and understanding functions that are not defined algebraically. This shall include working with affine transformations of functions, definitions of inverses and compositions of functions, and working with functions that are defined geometrically.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Students will demonstrate proficiency working with parametrized families of functions. These families shall include linear functions, polynomials, rational functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and trigonometric functions. Transformations, inverses, and compositions of such functions will also be addressed. Skills shall include finding parameter values from data, evaluating functions, solving equations, and selecting which family would best represent a given data set/real world application.

    <p>This course meets the following gtPathway Student Learning Outcomes: Quantitative Literacy.
    </p>
    <p>
    Competency in quantitative literacy represents a studentâ€™s ability to use quantifiable information and mathematical analysis to make connections and draw conclusions. Students with strong quantitative literacy skills understand and can create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc.).
