    <title>Academic Integrity</title>
    <p>
      <term>What is Academic Integrity?</term> Integrity is the College-wide expectation that students follow established guidelines and common knowledge to maintain ethical standards in their work.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>Why does it matter?</term> Integrity in academic matters is vital to all members of the College community. An academic integrity violation by a student devalues the accomplishments of other students, threatens the integrity of the College, and undermines the College’s educational mission. During their time at FLC, students are expected to know, understand, and comply with the ethical standards of the College.
    </p>
    <p>
      <term>What is Academic Dishonesty?</term> Academic dishonesty is defined as any form of unethical or illegal behavior regarding any academic work--with or without intent. These standards apply to all courses taken on or off campus, and all modes of course delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Examples of academic dishonesty include, but are not limited to, the following:
    </p>
      <ul>
  <li>

  </p>
  <p>

  </p>
  <p>
    <term>What are the consequences?</term> In-class consequences for a charge can range from a reduced grade or zero on the assignment to a reduced grade or “F” in the course. College-wide consequences can range from academic intervention to suspension or expulsion.
  </p>
  <p>
    <term>Course Policy on use of Generative Artificial Intelligence:</term> Generative artificial intelligence (GAI), such as ChatGPT and other large language models can be extremely helpful as study aids and personalized tutors. You can use them to help explain complex topics or create additional practice problems. However, <term>electronic devices and GAI use is forbidden on all exams and quizzes in this class.</term>
