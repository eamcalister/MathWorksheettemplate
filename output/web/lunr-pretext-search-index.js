Topics include functions, compositions and inverses, and domain and range. Polynomial, rational, exponential, logarithmic, and trigonometric functions are examined in depth, with an emphasis on symbolic methods, parameters that describe each family of functions, and multiple representations of functions (algebraic, numerical, graphical, and verbal representations).    Instructional Format  This is a face-to-face course, which means we will meet in person.    Course Materials  Required Text: Functions Modeling Change: A Preparation for Calculus - 6th Edition by Connally et. al. The text    Student Office Hours      Erich McAlister's Office Hours:      Levi Lorenzo's Office Hours:        Feedback and Communication  Communication of all course information will occur via Canvas as well as in class. Most assignments will be submitted and graded online in Canvas or Webwork.    Missing Class  If you need to miss class, that is ok. If you miss class, be sure to check Canvas and Webwork for assignments, and try to get notes from a classmate. If you're still having difficulty with the material, use office hours or the Peer Education Center to get caught up. If you need an extension on an assignment, just ask your professor and it will likely be granted.  If you need to miss class for an extended period of time, let your professor know so that we may work out a remote accommodation.    Technology and Software Requirements  You will need to be able to access Canvas and Webwork (online homework system) as submit assignments online. Internet access and a scanning device are required. Calculators will not be used on exams, but will frequently be useful for homework and in class.    Course Learning Outcomes     Students demonstrate an understanding of functions in multiple ways including graphical representations, algebraic representations, and verbal descriptions.    Students will demonstrate understanding of abstract function notation, proficiency working with abstract functions, and understanding functions that are not defined algebraically. This shall include working with affine transformations of functions, definitions of inverses and compositions of functions, and working with functions that are defined geometrically.    Students will demonstrate proficiency working with parametrized families of functions. These families shall include linear functions, polynomials, rational functions, exponential functions, logarithmic functions, and trigonometric functions. Transformations, inverses, and compositions of such functions will also be addressed. Skills shall include finding parameter values from data, evaluating functions, solving equations, and selecting which family would best represent a given data set\/real world application.       Program Learning Outcomes     Students will demonstrate competency in Algebra.    Students will demonstrate competency in Geometry.    Students will produce and deliver effective written and oral presentations of mathematical material and ideas.    Students will apply algebraic, geometric, and computational methods in abstract settings.    Students will apply algebraic, geometric, and computational methods in applied settings.       gTPathways  This course meets the following gtPathway Student Learning Outcomes: Quantitative Literacy.  Competency in quantitative literacy represents a studentâ€™s ability to use quantifiable information and mathematical analysis to make connections and draw conclusions. Students with strong quantitative literacy skills understand and can create sophisticated arguments supported by quantitative evidence and can clearly communicate those arguments in a variety of formats (using words, tables, graphs, mathematical equations, etc.).   Students should be able to:     Interpret Information     Explain information presented in mathematical forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words).      Represent Information     Convert information into and between various mathematical forms (e.g., equations, graphs, diagrams, tables, words).      Perform Calculations     Solve problems or equations at the appropriate course level.    Use appropriate mathematical notation.    Solve a variety of different problem types that involve a multi-step solution and address the validity of the results.      Apply and Analyze Information     Make use of graphical objects (such as graphs of equations in two or three variables, histograms, scatterplots of bivariate data, geometrical figures, etc.) to supplement a solution to a typical problem at the appropriate level.    Formulate, organize, and articulate solutions to theoretical and application problems at the appropriate course level.    Make judgments based on mathematical analysis appropriate to the course level.      Communicate Using Mathematical Forms     Express mathematical analysis symbolically, graphically, and in written language that clarifies\/justifies\/summarizes reasoning (may also include oral communication).       The gtPathways Student Learning Outcomes will be assessed through the following signature assignment(s): Final Exam.   "
